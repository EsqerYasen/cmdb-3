# About

Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is the source of truth and knowledge about all assets, whether is virtual or physical. Everything about hardware and software assets (commonly referred to as Configuration Items [CI]) are stored and encoded in CMDB to drive all automation processes. Programmable CMDB has a API-Centric design and focuses on managing CIs and their relations only, domain knowledges about different CIs are not included.
